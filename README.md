# 🏏 Hand Cricket Game in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

A fun, interactive hand cricket game implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook!  
Inspired by the hand cricket games we used to play during school breaks — now brought to life in code.

## 🎮 How to Play

- You (the player) and the computer take turns batting and bowling.
- Choose a number between **1 and 6**.
- If your number matches the computer’s number, you are **OUT**!
- The player with the highest score wins the match.

## 💻 Features

- Fully playable in a Jupyter Notebook
- Uses Python's `random` module for computer inputs
- Clear and easy-to-follow game flow
- Real-time scoring and two innings

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook installed (or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))

### How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `handcricket.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell in sequence to start playing the game


## 🧠 Concepts Used
